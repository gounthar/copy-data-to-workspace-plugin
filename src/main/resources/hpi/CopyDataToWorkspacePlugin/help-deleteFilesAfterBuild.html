    This optional feature automatically deletes all files copied to the workspace after the build completes.
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Deletion occurs after the build is fully completed</li>
            <li>Any files created during the build with the same names might also be deleted</li>
            <li>Ensure your build artifacts are not in the copied files list if you need to preserve them</li>
        </ul>
